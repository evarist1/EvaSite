# EvaSite
Portfolio project : MVP complete
PORTFOLIO PROJECT CHECKING 

## MVP Completed 

# Challenges:
-Discovered Challenges: In the research phase, unforeseen challenges emerged regarding data acquisition. While initial sources seemed robust, they lacked the granularity required for in-depth analysis.
-Adapting the Plan: To address this, I revised the data collection strategy, incorporating multiple sources and refining search parameters. Additionally, I developed data preprocessing techniques to enhance data quality.

# Non-Technical Challenges: 
Unexpectedly, time management emerged as a significant hurdle. Balancing project commitments with other responsibilities required careful prioritization and efficient task management.

# Collaboration:
I am working alone on the project. 
Peer Support: Engaging with peers and mentors provided valuable feedback and guidance, particularly in refining project objectives and troubleshooting technical issues.

# Project Updates:
Deliverable Changes: Adjustments are being made to the project's deliverables to accommodate the refined data collection process. This includes updating the timeline to allow for additional data processing and analysis.
Reasoning: By enhancing data quality and analysis depth, these changes aim to strengthen the project's overall validity and insights, aligning more closely with initial objectives.

# Progress:

Progress Rating (This Week): 10/10 progress rating
Progress is measured through milestone completion, data acquisition, preprocessing, and initial analysis.

# Rating Justification: 
Despite encountering challenges, significant progress was made in refining the data collection process and initiating analysis. However, additional time was required for unexpected data preprocessing complexities.

# Completion Assessment:
Given the current progress rate and adjustments made to the project plan, completion within the specified timeframe remains feasible. However, ongoing monitoring and adaptation will be crucial to ensuring timely delivery of the final product.

# Completed Projects as Planned
Type of Project and the Name

I decided to create EvaSite.

# Website Development
After the completion of our project name and the logo; we dive into the architectural aspect of web development to showcase our tent options, also provide detailed information, and allow customers to easily browse and select their preferred tents. Our online booking system has been integrated into the website, enabling customers to make reservations conveniently and securely.

# Market Research and Planning
We conducted self-comprehensive market research to identify target customer sections, assess competition, and understand industry trends. This step allowed us to develop a solid business plan and set clear objectives for our tent rental services. Upon completion of this research, we move into market strategies or rather marketing and advertising.

# Marketing and Publicity 
Our marketing efforts have been successfully executed as planned. We have implemented various digital marketing strategies, including Search Engine Optimization (SEO), social media campaigns, and targeted online advertisements. These initiatives helped us to raise awareness about our services, attract potential customers, and generate leads. 

# Uncompleted Projects (as Planned)
Since we have made significant progress in various aspects of our project as they were written earlier; yet, there are certain areas that remain incomplete, and they are as follows:

# Business Expansion
 While i have created the website, services, our project includes plans for expanding our operations to serve a broader geographical area or target new market sectors. However, the implementation of these expansion plans is still underway. We are in the process of evaluating potential locations, conducting market research, and developing strategies to ensure a successful expansion.

# Diversification of EvaSite Inventory 
While we have procured a diverse range of services to cater to different clients needs, our project includes a goal to continuously expand and diversify our tent inventory. 

# Customer Relationship Management
Building long-term relationships with our customers is an essential aspect of our project. While we have implemented customer service strategies and obtained valuable feedback, there is still work to be done in terms of developing a wide-ranging Customer Relationship Management (CRM) system. This system would allow us to effectively track customer interactions, personalize our services, and maintain strong connections with them.

Partnerships and Relationships Collaborations with various clinics, and hospitals, are vital for the growth and success of our clinic. While we have initiated some partnerships, the project includes ongoing efforts to establish and strengthen these collaborations. We are actively engaging with potential partners, negotiating contracts, and exploring mutually beneficial opportunities to enhance our service offerings.

Process Computerization 
Truly, in the world today, automation plays a crucial role in improving operational efficiency. While we have integrated an online booking system, there is ongoing work in automating other processes such as inventory management, invoicing, and reporting. Implementing robust automation systems will help streamline our operations, also to reduce manual errors, and enhance overall productivity.

## CHALLENGES in WEEK 2 

# Technical Challenge
The most difficult technical challenge encountered in the second week of my project was applying an efficient Inventory Management System (IMS). In the sense that managing a diverse catalog of services, accessories, and equipment required a robust system that could handle the complexities of tracking availability, bookings, and logistics.

One of the key headaches was designing a Centralized Database. This involved integrating various data sources, such as online bookings, manual reservations, and returns into a cohesive system. Ensuring data accuracy and consistency across different channels proved to be a complex task.

# Non-Technical Challenge
The most difficult non-technical challenge encountered in the second week of the project was how we could be managing our clients expectations and satisfaction. The nature of the business involved serving a wide range of clients with diverse needs and requirements, which required exceptional client service skills.

The principal non-technical challenge was dealing with last-minute changes or cancellations from clients. These unexpected alterations to bookings could disrupt the entire operational schedule and impact other customers' reservations. Effectively communicating and finding alternative solutions to accommodate changes while minimizing the impact on other customers was a significant challenge.

Handling customer complaints and resolving conflicts also proved to be demanding. Despite the best efforts to provide a seamless service, issues could arise, such as equipment malfunctions, delays, and unknown misunderstandings. Addressing these concerns promptly, empathetically, and satisfactorily was crucial to maintain customer loyalty and reputation.

Moreover, ensuring clear and effective communication with customers throughout the rental process presented challenges. From initial inquiries and reservations to delivery instructions and post-event feedback, maintaining timely and accurate communication required excellent organizational skills and attention to detail.

In order to overcome these non-technical challenges, the clinic personnels needed to prioritize clients satisfaction and invest in effective client service training. Implementing clear policies and procedures for handling changes, complaints, and communication would contribute to a positive customer experience. Additionally, having contingency plans and backup resources could help mitigate disruptions caused by unforeseen circumstances.
